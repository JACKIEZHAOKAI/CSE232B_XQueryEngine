XQuery Execution Engine (Database)
•	Implemented a query engine that can parse both XPath and XQuery expression and query on XML file, built query parser using Antlr4, evaluated the query using a recursive evaluation routine and output the result node list in XML file.
•	Optimized the engine by detecting the FLWR clause, rewriting the XQuery with join operator, and computing with hash join.
